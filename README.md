# 2048 Project

## Functioning 2048 game written in python utilizing random and IPython.display libraries. 

This project was created individually and allowed me to gain a better understanding of matrices and sortings. In my project, I used an insertion sorting technique to check the two values to see if they can combine. 
The first blob includes the functions I created in order to run the game. The second box is where I imput my functions and make the game going.
